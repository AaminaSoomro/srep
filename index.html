  <h2>Directions</h2>
<ol> 
  <li>In a large bowl, combine shredded zucchini, corn, green onions, chickpea flour, garlic, cumin, oregano, thyme, salt & pepper.</li>
  <li>Stir together until well combined.</li> 
  <li>Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes. This step is important because the flour will absorb the moisture from the zucchini and create a batter.</li> 
  <li>Warm a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Grease with preferred cooking oil then scoop out 1/4 cup of the zucchini mixture at a time into the skillet.</li> 
  <li>Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until light golden brown.</li> 
  <li>Serve warm with black beans, salsa, nacho cashew cream and/or avocado then enjoy!</li>

  <h3>Daily Review:</h3>
<i>"After a quick trip to the farmer’s market I was looking for a quick vegan meal for the evening.  I had limited prep time and wanted something filling and delicious.  My eye caught the Zucchini Corn Fritters.  They were a snitch to prepare, delicious and filling.  Normally I modify the recipe in several ways but not this one.  I prepared, cooked and served them as recommended.  I highly recommend you make this dish a regular at your kitchen table. ~angela"</i>
